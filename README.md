ChargingPoint. 

As somone who is very interested in modern cars, i am very aware  of the latestest technologies emerging in cars, be it the latest ADAS feature or the latest power units, primarily electric Power units. 
When your interested in a topic like this its no effort to find out any information you wish. However, what if your not remotely interested in cars? what if you just want to get from A to B and want to get there 
without harming the environment. Thats where an electric car comes in. 

The problem with electric cars is that you have to charge them. As someone whos is interested in electric cars, I am constantly noticing new charing points popping up around the country. Again, unless you are interested
this, you wont notice them. They'll blend into the background just like a parking meter. And that will cause a serious problem when you only have two kilometers of range left and no idea where your nearest charging point
is. 

Thats where this website comes in. Simply bookmark this site and and you have can find a charging point with just a few clicks or taps. Plan your trip and where you want to charge or, wait untill you arive at your destination
and find your nearest charging point then. 

I though it was key to create a website that is simple and usable. The websites main function is to allow users to locate a charging point, using a large map on the home page, but also give information on different electric vehicles for those 
who may be unsure about what electric vehicle to buy. There is also a contact page where a user can send a message requesting further information on a particular EV. 


UX

This website can be used by anyone. It serves many different functions. 

The Main use for this website is to help the user locate an Electric Vehicle charging station. This is achived once you open the site and are greeting with a lrge map showing the locations of charging points around Ireland. 
This map is ideal for any website user, from someone who already owns an EV and is away from home but needs to locate their nearest charger, down to someone who is thinking of going electric and wants to find out where thier local 
charging station is. 

The second use for the website is for information. There is a page with different examples of electric cars currently availabe in Ireland. Again, this is ideal for sombody lokking to upgrade thier current EV or
sombody who is looking to but their first EV and wants to find out whats on the market. 

The third and final function of the website is again to aquire information about EVs. By using a contact form on the contact page the user can send a message with a request for further information about any of the vehicles
displayed on the examples page or any other EV. 

The entire website is laid out in an easy to use way so that anybody can navigate it. 


Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features

The first feature on this website is the interactive map that shows the locations of charging points. The locations of the charge points were aquied using a free APi


Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.


Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
